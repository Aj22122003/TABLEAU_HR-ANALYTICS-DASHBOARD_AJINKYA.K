# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

This project involved the creation of an HR Analytics Dashboard using Tableau. The goal of this dashboard is to empower HR teams with data-driven insights to understand employee attrition patterns through intuitive, interactive visualizations, ultimately aiming to reduce turnover and improve retention strategies.

## Key Insights & Features Included in the Dashboard:

* ✅ **Overall Attrition Rate with dynamic filters:** Provides a clear view of the total attrition within the organization, allowing users to filter by various dimensions.
* ✅ **Department-wise Attrition to identify which teams are most impacted:** Highlights departments experiencing the highest attrition rates, enabling targeted interventions.
* ✅ **Age-wise Attrition Trends, helping visualize which age groups are at higher risk:** Identifies age demographics with higher attrition, aiding in understanding potential generational factors.
* ✅ **Gender-wise Attrition Comparison to uncover any imbalance:** Allows for the analysis of attrition rates between genders to identify and address potential disparities.
* ✅ **Education Field vs Attrition, to analyze trends across different educational backgrounds:** Explores the relationship between employees' education fields and their likelihood of attrition.
* ✅ **Job Role vs Attrition, highlighting roles with the highest attrition rates:** Pinpoints specific job roles that experience the most turnover, enabling focused retention efforts.
* ✅ **Distance from Home vs Attrition, exploring how commute impacts retention:** Investigates the correlation between the distance employees live from work and their attrition.
* ✅ **Box Plots for analyzing statistical distribution and outliers across departments:** Provides a statistical overview of attrition distribution and helps identify any unusual patterns within departments.

## Some Major Highlights:

1.  **Overall Attrition Overview:** A clear visual summary showing the percentage of employees who have left, powered by dynamic filters for department, gender, and education.
2.  **Department-Wise Attrition:** Bar charts that help HR teams identify high-risk departments, aiding in team-specific interventions.
3.  **Age & Gender Insights:** Line and pie charts break down attrition by age group and gender, revealing underlying patterns and disparities.
4.  **Attrition vs Distance from Home:** A line chart that shows how commute length correlates with employee turnover.
5.  **Education Field & Job Role Analysis:** Side-by-side bar charts that compare attrition across various educational backgrounds and job functions, helping identify roles where retention efforts may be urgently needed.
6.  **Box Plots by Department:** Advanced visualizations to detect outliers, understand distribution, and analyze variability within teams.
7.  **Interactive Filters:** Built-in dropdowns and sliders allow users to customize the view by department, marital status, and other demographic details.

## Impact and Learnings:

The dashboard was designed with user-friendly filters and clear visuals to make complex data easy to interpret, ensuring that HR decision-makers can take quick and effective actions based on real insights.

This project enhanced skills in data storytelling, dashboard design, and Tableau. It was a great exercise in translating raw HR data into meaningful business narratives.

## Looking Ahead:

Looking forward to growing further in the field of data visualization and analytics!
